Asset Manager
================

##Description
Develop an automated bidding application that automatically emails a bid with the corresponding contact info, part info and value and then provides a link to remove the part from the inventory in the email.  This will allow users to view the currently listed parts.  List new parts as an administrator.  Create new users in the system.
